# Challenge 03: Deploy NVIDIA NIM on Azure

### Estimated Time: 120 Minutes

## Introduction

This lab guides participants through deploying NVIDIA NeMo Inference Manager (NIM) on Azure, which facilitates rapid development and deployment of sophisticated AI models for various applications. NVIDIA NIM is a model deployment and management solution that enables efficient utilization of NVIDIA GPUs for AI model inference. This deployment involves using Azure's powerful cloud infrastructure to host NIM containers, which simplifies the integration of AI models into production environments by managing model lifecycle, deployment, and scaling in Azure Machine Learning (AML) services.

Participants will begin by creating an NVIDIA account to generate an API key, essential for accessing NVIDIAâ€™s NGC resources, such as container images for NeMo models. Then, the lab covers setting up Azure Container Registry (ACR) for storing these images, configuring Git Bash to interact with Azure, and updating relevant configuration files within Visual Studio Code. After this setup, participants will deploy the NIM container through Azure Machine Learning, which will handle the GPU-based model deployment and expose it through a managed online endpoint.

## Solution Guide

## Task 1: Generate NGC API KEY

> **Note:** This process of getting the NGC API key is no longer recommended. The participant is recommended to get the API key through build.nvidia.com as mentioned on the Scenario page.

The NVIDIA API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests to NVIDIA's APIs, such as the NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud) services. This key allows developers to access various resources, including pre-trained models, GPU-accelerated software, and container images. Obtaining an API key typically involves creating an account on NVIDIA's developer portal and generating the key within the account settings. It is important to keep this key secure, as it grants access to your NVIDIA resources and can be used for billing purposes.
