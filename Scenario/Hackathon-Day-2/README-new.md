# Activate Gen AI - 2 Day Hackathon

Welcome to the Activate Gen AI Hackathon. This two-day event is designed to immerse you in the world of AI application development, harnessing the power and versatility of the Azure OpenAI Service.

## Introduction

Delve into the world of Azure OpenAI. This event is designed to enhance your AI application development skills, regardless of your current experience level. Through the self-administered challenges, you'll apply your knowledge, build practical solutions, and acquire a deeper understanding of implementing AI solutions using Azure OpenAI.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Understand GenAI concepts and how they can be used to build chat applications.
- Learn how to configure the Azure OpenAI service and use Azure AI Search to build private OpenAI with your own data.
- Gain practical experience in implementing a chat app architecture with Terraform.
- Explore features of chat apps, such as multilingual queries and advanced chat response settings.
- Apply GenAI to real-world scenarios, including increased user interactions and dynamic document processing.
- Operationalize AI-enabled applications with enterprise-level monitoring and logging.
- Scale AI-enabled applications with enterprise-level load balancing.


## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon adopts a challenge-based format, offering you a unique opportunity to learn while dealing with practical problems. Each challenge includes one or more self-contained tasks designed to test and enhance your skills in specific aspects of AI app development. You will approach these challenges by:

- Analyzing the problem statement.
- Strategizing your approach to find the most effective solution.
- Leveraging the provided lab environment and Azure Open AI tools.
- Collaborating with peers to refine and implement your solutions.

## Challenges Overview

1. **Challenge 01: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and LLM Models**
   - Deploy the Azure OpenAI Service and implement the deployment of a Large Language Model (LLM) within the OpenAI Service.
     
2. **Challenge 02: Implement Document Search with Azure AI Search**
   - Construct an Azure AI Search solution to enable sophisticated document handling. Upload, index, and tailor the search experience using VS Code and Azure. This lays the groundwork for document-based questioning essential for Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) in OpenAI.

3. **Challenge 03: Deploy an AI-Powered Chat App**
   - Utilize Bicep to deploy a sample chat application on Azure, automating the provisioning of all necessary resources. This challenge will demonstrate your ability to get an application up and running in the cloud.
          
4. **Challenge 04: Interact with the Chat App**
   - Explore the deployed web app, engaging with the Chat App through well-constructed inquiries. Display your ability to handle multilingual queries and make use of advanced settings to deepen your understanding of the Azure OpenAI service's capabilities.
     
5. **Challenge 05: Implement Monitoring and Logging of Azure OpenAI Using API Management Service**
   - Operationalize your solution by setting up monitoring and logging. Use Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and APIM to gain insights and maintain the robustness of your AI services.

6. **Challenge 06: Implement Monitoring and Logging of Azure OpenAI Using API Management Service**
   - Operationalize your solution by setting up monitoring and logging. Use Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and APIM to gain insights and maintain the robustness of your AI services.

Feel free to explore the challenges, learn, and have fun during this hackathon! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your coach.

Happy hacking!
