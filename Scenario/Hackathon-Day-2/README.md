## Challenges

1. **Challenge 01: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and LLM Models**
   - Begin your journey by deploying the Azure OpenAI Service and integrating a Large Language Model (LLM). This will serve as the foundation for advanced linguistic intelligence in your applications.
     
2. **Challenge 02: Implement Document Search with Azure AI Search**
   - Construct an Azure AI Search solution to enable sophisticated document handling. Upload, index, and tailor the search experience using VS Code and Azure. This lays the groundwork for document-based questioning, essential for Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) in OpenAI.

3. **Challenge 03: Deploy NVIDIA NIM on Azure**
   - Deploy NVIDIA NIM to Azure to harness powerful, scalable generative AI model hosting. This guide walks you through setting up NVIDIA NIMâ€”a suite of optimized microservices specifically designed for deploying and managing generative AI models on NVIDIA GPUs. Using Azure and NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud), you will deploy models like meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct with streamlined configuration, security, and performance features. By leveraging the NIM containerization on Azure, you'll establish an efficient and secure environment for real-time AI inference that is suitable for complex generative AI applications.
            
4. **Challenge 04: Deploy an AI-Powered Chat App**
   - Utilize Terraform to deploy a sample chat application on Azure, automating the provisioning of all necessary resources. This challenge will demonstrate your ability to get an application up and running in the cloud.
                         
5. **Challenge 05: Serverless Document Batch Processing**
   - Embrace the power of serverless computing for batch-processing documents. Analyze documents using Azure Document Intelligence Services and process them with OpenAI. 
     
6. **Challenge 06: Implement Monitoring and Logging of Azure OpenAI Using API Management Service**
   - Operationalize your solution by setting up monitoring and logging. Use Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and APIM to gain insights and maintain the robustness of your AI services.
