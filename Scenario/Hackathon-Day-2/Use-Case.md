# Hackathon Mission and Use-Case
Welcome to the Activate Generative AI with Azure Hackathon, proudly presented by Contoso Ltd. Our mission is to leverage the power of Azure OpenAI to revolutionize Contoso's technology stack, streamlining operations and scaling customer engagement like never before. This hackathon serves as a beacon of innovation, challenging you to build AI-enabled solutions that are not only transformative but also scalable and efficient.

As a beacon of innovation in the business world, Contoso Ltd. is unwavering in its commitment to leading the charge in the adoption of cutting-edge technologies. We recognize the incredible potential of Azure OpenAI services to transform every aspect of our business operations. Our goal for this hackathon is to explore and implement AI-driven applications that seamlessly integrate with our existing infrastructure, thereby enhancing operational scalability and enriching customer interactions.

Your challenge, as the torchbearers of innovation, is to dive deep into the world of Azure OpenAI and harness its robust capabilities. Contoso Ltd. is counting on you to design and deploy applications that will:

1. **Integrate Azure OpenAI into Contoso's Corporate Ecosystem**
    - Deploy and experiment with LLMs to enrich GenTech's communication channels, focusing on interpreting, analyzing, and summarizing internal and external communications for more streamlined and impactful exchanges.
2. **Implement Intelligent Document Search**
    - Engineer innovative tools that allow for efficient indexing and searching of vast document repositories, enabling rapid retrieval of information and knowledge discovery, crucial for informed decision-making within GenTech.
3. **Establish AI-Powered Chat Interactions**
    -  Deploy and refine conversational AI interfaces within Contoso's digital ecosystem, ensuring they can handle intricate, multilingual conversations with finesse, thereby elevating the user experience on our platforms.
4. **Establish AI-Powered Personalized Chat Experience with Private Data**
    - Enhance the conversational AI interfaces by equipping them with personalized data, such as by building a bot for employees to inquire about the company's benefits.
6. **Enhanced Document Handling and Accessibility**
    - In the fast-paced environment at Contoso Ltd., the ability to quickly access and interpret a vast array of documents is paramount. By implementing AI-driven document indexing and searching, Contoso can vastly improve knowledge management and operational efficiency.
7. **Operationalizing AI Solutions**
    - Contoso would like to evaluate the technologies available to operationalize the solutions, with proper logging and monitoring to ensure continuous availability and SLAs.Â 

## Important Notes to Group Members:
 
1. Each team member will be assigned a dedicated lab virtual machine, with each machine having its resource group. Do not use these RGs for anything else; they are just used to host your virtual machine.
2. All Azure deployments and resources must be created in the **<inject key="Resource Group Name"/>** resource group designated. All validations are initiated against this resource group.
3. The validations and your challenge completion will not function if you do not use this **<inject key="Resource Group Name"/>** resource group.
4. For Challenge validations involving cloud resources deployment in **<inject key="Resource Group Name"/>**, anyone from the team can initiate the validation and check for results.
5. For challenges validation involving running the app locally with virtual machines, the team member who has the app running must initiate the validation, i.e. if Team Member ABC has an app running their VM,  they should initiate validations as VM validations are executed against individual virtual machines.
6. If you deploy cloud resources in other RGs other than **<inject key="Resource Group Name"/>**, validation will not be successful, as validations will check for target resources in **<inject key="Resource Group Name"/>** RG only.
7. Please contact your coach if you believe you've completed the challenge via other means and validations not allowing you to move forward due to resources not being deployed in **<inject key="Resource Group Name"/>**.

Throughout the challenges of this hackathon, you will interact with state-of-the-art technologies essential for realizing Contoso's objectives. You will be equipped with the necessary arsenal of tools and services to effectively bring these use cases to fruition.

At Contoso Ltd., we are convinced that the integration of Azure OpenAI into our applications is not merely an enhancement of our workflow but a catalyst for delivering exceptional value to our stakeholders. This hackathon is more than a competition; it represents a pivotal leap towards an era where AI is an integral part of every solution we craft. Join us in this enthralling venture to extend the boundaries of what's achievable with AI in enterprise application development.
