# Challenge 01: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and LLM Models

### Estimated Time: 30 Minutes

## Introduction

**Azure OpenAI Service** provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models, including the GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, `gpt-35-turbo`, and Embeddings model series. In addition, the new `GPT-4` and `gpt-35-turbo` model series have now reached general availability.

A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is a deep learning algorithm that can perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Large language models use transformer models and are trained using massive datasetsâ€”hence, large. This enables them to recognize, translate, predict, or generate text or other content.

**Contoso Ltd.**, a leading technological firm, is seeking to enhance its product support operations. They receive a vast number of queries daily, which results in longer waiting times and decreased customer satisfaction. To address this, Contoso is planning to implement an AI-powered solution that can handle customer inquiries effectively and efficiently.

They have chosen to deploy Azure OpenAI Service along with its Large Language Models (LLM), like `gpt-35-turbo` and `text-embedding-ada-002`. These models are known for their capability in processing and generating human-like text, making them ideal for this application.

As a part of this challenge, your task is to create an Azure OpenAI service and deploy Large Language Models (LLM). The LLMs include **gpt-35-turbo** and **text-embedding-ada-002**.

### Accessing the Azure portal

1. To access the Azure portal, open a private/incognito window in your browser and navigate to the Azure Portal.

1. On the **Sign in to Microsoft Azure tab**, you will see a login screen. Enter the following email/username, and then click on **Next**.

   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

1. Now enter the following password and click on **Sign in**.

   - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

1. If you see the pop-up **Stay Signed in?**, click No.

1. If you see the pop-up **You have free Azure Advisor recommendations!**, close the window to continue with the challenge.

1. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** pop-up window appears, click **Cancel** to skip the tour.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following from the CloudLabs-provided integrated environment:

> Note: Prerequisites are already set up in the CloudLabs-provided environment. If you're using your personal computer or laptop, please make sure that all necessary prerequisites are installed to complete this hackathon.

  - [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
  - [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) access is available with the following models:
    - gpt-35-turbo
    - text-embedding-ada-002

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Azure OpenAI Service Deployment:**
   - Set up an Azure OpenAI Service instance with SKU size Standard `S0`.
   - Deploy it in the existing resource group named - **<inject key="Resource Group Name"/>**
   - Once the Azure OpenAI is deployed, obtain the necessary Azure OpenAI Key and Endpoint.
   - Please ensure the Azure OpenAI Service name follows this format: **OpenAI-xxxxxx**, where xxxxxx should be replaced with your specific **Deployment ID**.

2. **Deploy Large Language Models (LLM):**
   - Azure OpenAI provides a web-based portal named **Azure OpenAI Studio** that you can use to deploy, manage, and explore models. You'll start your exploration of Azure OpenAI by using Azure 
    OpenAI Studio to deploy a model.
   - Launch Azure OpenAI Studio from the overview pane and deploy two OpenAI models, i.e., `gpt-35-turbo` and `text-embedding-ada-002`, with a TPM capacity of 20k.

## Success Criteria:

- Verify that the Azure OpenAI Service is successfully deployed in the existing resource group - <inject key="Resource Group Name"/>.
- Verify that the Large Language Models (LLM), `gpt-35-turbo` and `text-embedding-ada-002`, are successfully deployed with the Azure OpenAI Service.
