# Activate Generative AI with Azure: 1-Day Attendee Guide

Welcome to the Activate GenAI Hackathon! Today, you're set to dive into the transformative world of AI, with a focus on utilizing the power of Azure OpenAI services. Prepare yourself for a day of intense learning, innovation, and hands-on experience that will elevate your understanding of AI integration in application development.

## Introduction

Your quest is to innovate for the future at the fictitious enterprise, GenTech Inc. Your challenge? To integrate next-generation AI capabilities into GenTech's ecosystem, enhancing their operations and customer engagement through intelligent application development.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Gain practical experience in deploying and managing Azure OpenAI services, including Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Develop competencies in implementing intelligent document search capabilities using Azure AI.
- Acquire the ability to set up and deploy a conversational AI interface with a sample chat application.
- Enhance your problem-solving skills by addressing real-world scenarios with AI-driven solutions.
- Collaborate with other participants to tackle challenges and share insights.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based
This hackathon adopts a challenge-based format, offering you a unique opportunity to learn while dealing with practical problems. Each challenge includes one or more self-contained tasks designed to test and enhance your skills in specific aspects of AI app development. You will approach these challenges by:

- Analyzing the problem statement.
- Strategizing your approach to find the most effective solution.
- Leveraging the provided lab environment and Azure AI services.
- Collaborating with peers to refine and implement your solutions.
  
## Challenges

1. **Challenge 01: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and LLM Models**

    - Begin your journey by deploying the Azure OpenAI Service and integrating a Large Language Model (LLM). This will serve as the foundation for advanced linguistic intelligence in your applications.
  
2. **Challenge 02: Implement Document Search with Azure AI Search**
 
   - Construct an Azure AI Search solution to enable sophisticated document handling. Upload, index, and tailor the search experience using VS Code and Azure. This lays the groundwork for document-based questioning, essential for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in OpenAI.

3. **Challenge 03: Deploy NVIDIA NIM on Azure**

   - Deploy NVIDIA NIM to Azure to harness powerful, scalable generative AI model hosting. This guide walks you through setting up NVIDIA NIM, a suite of optimized microservices specifically designed for deploying and managing generative AI models on NVIDIA GPUs. Using Azure and NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud), you will deploy models like meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct with streamlined configuration, security, and performance features. By leveraging the NIM containerization on Azure, you'll establish an efficient and secure environment for real-time AI inference that is suitable for complex generative AI applications.
            
4. **Challenge 04: Deploy an AI-Powered Chat App**
 
   - Utilize bicep to deploy a sample chat application on Azure, automating the provisioning of all necessary resources. This challenge will demonstrate your ability to get an application up and running in the cloud.
