# Activate Generative AI with Azure: 1-Day Attendee Guide

Welcome to the Activate GenAI Hackathon! Today, you're set to dive into the transformative world of AI, with a focus on utilizing the power of Azure OpenAI services. Prepare yourself for a day of intense learning, innovation, and hands-on experience that will elevate your understanding of AI integration in application development.

## Introduction

Your quest is to innovate for the future at the fictitious enterprise, GenTech Inc. Your challenge? To integrate next-generation AI capabilities into GenTech's ecosystem, enhancing their operations and customer engagement through intelligent application development.


## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Gain practical experience in deploying and managing Azure OpenAI services, including Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Develop competencies in implementing intelligent document search capabilities using Azure AI.
- Acquire the ability to set up and deploy a conversational AI interface with a sample chat application.
- Enhance your problem-solving skills by addressing real-world scenarios with AI-driven solutions.
- Collaborate with other participants to tackle challenges and share insights.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based
This hackathon adopts a challenge-based format, offering you a unique opportunity to learn while dealing with practical problems. Each challenge includes one or more self-contained tasks designed to test and enhance your skills in specific aspects of AI app development. You will approach these challenges by:

- Analyzing the problem statement.
- Strategizing your approach to find the most effective solution.
- Leveraging the provided lab environment and Azure AI services.
- Collaborating with peers to refine and implement your solutions.
  
## Challenges

1. **Challenge 01: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and LLM Models**

    - Begin your journey by deploying the Azure OpenAI Service and integrating a Large Language Model (LLM). This will serve as the foundation for advanced linguistic intelligence in your applications.
  
2. **Challenge 02: Implement Document Search with Azure AI Search**
 
   - Construct an Azure AI Search solution to enable sophisticated document handling. Upload, index, and tailor the search experience using VS Code and Azure. This lays the groundwork for document-based questioning, essential for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in OpenAI.

3. **Challenge 03: Deploy NVIDIA NIM on Azure**

   - Deploy NVIDIA NIM to Azure to harness powerful, scalable generative AI model hosting. This guide walks you through setting up NVIDIA NIM a suite of optimized microservices specifically designed for deploying and managing generative AI models on NVIDIA GPUs. Using Azure and NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud), you will deploy models like meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct with streamlined configuration, security, and performance features. By leveraging the NIM containerization on Azure, you'll establish an efficient and secure environment for real-time AI inference that is suitable for complex generative AI applications.
            
4. **Challenge 04: Deploy an AI-Powered Chat App**
 
   - Utilize bicep to deploy a sample chat application on Azure, automating the provisioning of all necessary resources. This challenge will demonstrate your ability to get an application up and running in the cloud.
                
Each challenge comes with its own set of tasks and objectives. Feel free to explore the challenges, learn, and have fun during this hackathon! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your coach.

Happy hacking!
