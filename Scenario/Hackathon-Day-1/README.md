## Challenges

1. **Challenge 01: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and LLM Models**
   - Begin your journey by deploying the Azure OpenAI Service and integrating a Large Language Model (LLM). This will serve as the foundation for advanced linguistic intelligence in your applications.
     
2. **Challenge 02: Implement Document Search with Azure AI Search**
   - Construct an Azure AI Search solution to enable sophisticated document handling. Upload, index, and tailor the search experience using VS Code and Azure. This lays the groundwork for document-based questioning essential for Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) in OpenAI.
             
3. **Challenge 03: Deploy an AI-Powered Chat App**
   - Utilize Bicep to deploy a sample chat application on Azure, automating the provisioning of all necessary resources. This challenge will demonstrate your ability to get an application up and running in the cloud.
          
4. **Challenge 04: Interact with the Chat App**
   - Explore the deployed web app, engaging with the Chat App through well-constructed inquiries. Display your ability to handle multilingual queries and make use of advanced settings to deepen your understanding of the Azure OpenAI service's capabilities.
                    
Each challenge comes with its own set of tasks and objectives. Feel free to explore the challenges, learn, and have fun during this hackathon! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your coach.
